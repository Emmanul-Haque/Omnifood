# Omnifood &mdash; Never Cook Again!

Welcome to my GitHub repository for *Omnifood,  AI-powered meal planning and delivery website*. This website is a research based hypothetical project while pursuing a course modules by Jonas Schmedtmann.


This README provides an overview of the website, along with information on the skills used and the tools employed duringÂ development.

## About

We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. 

- We want to solve this problem by using an **AI-centric approach**.         

- Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our *AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan*. But we don't stop there. 
- We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. 
- All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
### Features

- **Never cook again!**: Our subscriptions cover 365 days per year, even including major holidays.
- **Local and organic**: Our cooks only use local, fresh, and organic products to prepare your meals.
- **No waste**: All our partners only use reusable containers to package all your meals.
- **Pause anytime**: Going on vacation? Just pause your subscription, and we refund unused days.
## Skills
